- 👋 Hi, I’m @davildaran
- 👀 I’m interested in Large Language Models, Machine Learning, NLP, Platform Engineering, travel, books, food. 
- 🌱 I’m currently using Golang, Kubernetes, GitOps, Platform Engineering, GitHub Actions, Terraform, CUE, Grafana, Loki, Prometheus. I also have some experience with TypeScript, React, Python.
  - I'm playing around with microk8s locally to set up a fullstack application plus Observability stack. An attempt at a PaaS that can be cloud agnostic and little to no vendor lock-in.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I use that I find helpful or fun. I've started writing some (hopefully) helpful API calls for the Habitica app. 
- 📫 How to reach me: davildaran@gmail.com
